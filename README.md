# Rock Paper Scisscors in Python!

### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose. 

Prerequisites: all ya'll need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, nav to correct dir - <code>cd dir</code> - and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for mac / Linux.

The rules are the same as classic rps:

1. Paper covers Rock.

2. Scissors cuts Paper.

2. Rock smashes Scissors. 

*Choose wisely!*

Computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with Python 3.
